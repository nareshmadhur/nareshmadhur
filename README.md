- 👋 Hi, I’m @nareshmadhur
- 👀 I’m new to Git, but am determined to learn to master this tool after seeing the advantages this has!
- 🌱 I’m currently an MLE at METRO services, but I hope I update this file when I no longer work here.
- 💞️ I’m intersted in data science and machine learning. So please feel free to reach out if there are any fascinating projects you want to work on. Since I'm still new to this, I might be a bit slow to catch-up but I promise dedication.
- 📫 You can reach me on my email - nareshmadhur<at>gmail<dot>com
