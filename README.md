# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @nareshmadhur

I am a **Technophile** driving business transformation through data, governance, and high-impact technology.

## ðŸ’» Professional Expertise

I specialize in transforming organizations to be truly **data-driven**. With **over 5 years of experience** in a European wholesale business context, my focus areas include developing **data-driven strategies, BI governance, and high-impact AI/ML use cases** [1, 2].

## ðŸŒ± Current Focus

This project was started as a way to learn about the recent hype around **vibe-driven development**, believing that getting my hands dirty is the best way to truly learn and understand a new technology [3].

## ðŸŽ¨ Creative Pursuits

When I step away from the keyboard, I pursue music and photography [1]. I focus on a blend of **Carnatic tradition and contemporary music** [1] and am currently busy **collaborating with local artists in the Netherlands** [2]. As a **Shutterbug**, I maintain a visual diary by **capturing singular moments with intention** [1], with **Portraits remaining my dominant interest** for personal logging [3].

## ðŸ“« Connect with Me
