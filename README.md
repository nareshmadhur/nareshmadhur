## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a **Strategic Data Leader** and **Business Intelligence Expert** based in Amsterdam. My work focuses on translating complex data capabilities into measurable business value. I don't just build models; I build the **governance, culture, and architecture** required to make them scale.

*   🔭 **Currently working on:** Transforming "Shadow IT" into governed, scalable Data Ecosystems.
*   🌱 **Currently learning:** Production-Grade LLM Ops (RAG Eval)
*   💬 **Ask me about:** Data Strategy, ROI of AI, Semantic Layers, and Carnatic Guitar.
*   ⚡ **Fun fact:** I treat my guitar practice with the same algorithmic rigor as my code.

## 🎸 Beyond the Code

I operate on a **"Grounded Ambition"** philosophy. High performance requires deep recovery.

*   **🎵 The Musician:** I am an active Guitarist & Vocalist, fusing Western theory with **Carnatic (Indian Classical)** discipline.
*   **📸 The Photographer:** Capturing the stillness in chaos.
*   **🧠 The Investor:** Building wealth for autonomy, strictly following a "Sovereign Investor" mindset.
