# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @nareshmadhur

I am defined by my focus on high-impact technology and my creative expression as a Musician and Shutterbug, all documented as a continuous journey [conversation history].

I am a **Technophile** driving business transformation through data, governance, and high-impact technology [1].

## ðŸŒ± Current Focus

I believe that getting my hands dirty is the best way to truly learn and understand a new technology [3]. My projects, such as this one, serve as a way to explore new concepts, like the recent hype around **vibe-driven development** [3].

## ðŸŽ¨ Creative Pursuits

When I step away from the keyboard, I pursue music and photography [1].

### Musician ðŸŽ¶
My passion for music started early due to my musically inclined parents [2]. I focus on a blend of **Carnatic tradition and contemporary music** [1]. I offer performances and lessons and currently, I am busy **collaborating with local artists in the Netherlands** to further grow in the performing space [2].

### Shutterbug ðŸ“¸
This third interest was inspired by my uncle's passion [3]. I maintain a visual diary by **capturing singular moments with intention** [1]. While I explore landscapes and stories found in everyday life, **Portraits remain my dominant interest** for personal logging [1, 3].
